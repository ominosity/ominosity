>"The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. No matter our talents, education, or backgrounds, you each have an inherent wish to create something that did not exist before. Everyone can create. You don't need money, position, or influence in order to create something of substance or beauty. Creation brings satisfaction and fulfillment. We develop ourselves and others when you take unorganized matter into our hands and mold it into something of beauty."

# Welcome
My name is Richard Burgener, and I'd like to formally welcome you to my GitHub profile. Here are a couple of basic facts about me:
* üå≤Born and raised (for 42 years) in Utah, my beloved wife and I live in the beautiful state of Oregon
* üòªI've been working in the Animal Welfare space since 2009
  * Five years as onsite IT for an animal shelter
  * In software development and support on Animal Shelter Management software ever since (mostly the <a href="https://chameleonbeach.com/" target="_blank">Chameleon Software Suite</a> with a brief stint working on <a href="http://24pet.com/products/petpoint">PetPoint</a>)
* ‚öôÔ∏èI have a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology - Software Emphasis from <a href="https://wgu.edu/" target="_blank">Western Governor's University</a>
* ‚öôÔ∏èI'm working towards a Bachelor of Applied Science in Software Development from <a href="https://www.byupathway.edu/" target="_blank">BYU Pathways (and BYU Idaho)</a>
* üèóÔ∏èAs the quote suggests, what I love most about development is creating new things. In particular, I love creating new tools that help others accomplish their goals easier and in more meaningful ways
* üîÉI strive towards continuous improvement, both in my self and in my work. I'm always interested in learning new things and making good things better
* üèÖI believe in the value of teamwork. I believe the most productive teams are those where members focus on helping each other at least as much as 'doing their job.' Nobody alone can accomplish what a cohesive team can, no matter how talented or experienced they are
* ‚úçÔ∏èThough I have limited formal education in it (thus far), I am passionate about writing good technical documentation. Things that aren't written down aren't remembered. Having knowledge in your mind is great, but if you can't share that with others, then it dies with you

## My Current Skills and Experience
Most of my software development skills have been learned on-the-job and then expanded through additional education.

## My Future Skills
As I've studied Web Development, it's become clear that I need experience in a popular front-end library (other than Bootstrap). While the majority of my learning focus will be through BYU Pathways, I am actively seeking additional learning to broaden my skillset.

## GitHub Stats
Though I've worked in the industry for a long time, my projects have always been proprietary. Since I can't highlight specifics of what I've done, I'm now actively working on building a portfolio here. This portfolio mostly contains work done for school, so you can see the progression of my development, and I hope to start some private projects soon. Just as soon as I figure out what I want to code... üòâ

## My favorite development tools
Just as a gardener has a favorite trowel, a developer has favorite interface. These are the ones I'm using every day, either professionally or educationally.

## Gaming
Growing up, I dreamt of one-day becoming a video game designer. Life had other plans and I love working on more 'productive' projects, but the gamer lives on in my heart!
